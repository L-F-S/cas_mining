#5/08/2019 update:
#moved the project inside a cas_mining folder, therefore all paths must have the cas_mining
folder added to them. I'm not chanigning this for the past steps, because I shouldn t be running them in theory.


THIS FOLDER should contain all the script used to run the data mining pipeline.
Each step is numbered. Ideally, the output of the nth step is the input of
the n+1th step. Plus some data analysis along the way. Plus this is not
true for step 1 and 2, because I will need both their output
to go inside step3, that will be the construction of a HUGE TABLE.

+++++++++++++++++++++ USEFUL path abbreviations used in all READMEs
Data produced is stored in the subfolders of
data="/shares/CIBIO-Storage/CM/scratch/tmp_projects/signorini_cas"
with the same name of the step they were produced in (e.g. $data/0pre_analyses/)

All the initial data is stored in:
/scratchCM/tmp_projects/epasolli_darkmatter/allcontigs/ALLreconstructedgenomes
which contains all genomes in fasta, sorted by sgb ID
, or
/scratchCM/tmp_projects/epasolli_darkmatter/allcontigs/
<dataset_name>/metabat/genomes_comp50_cont05/prokka/<sample_ID>/
which contains all genomes and annotations, sorted by dataset name
